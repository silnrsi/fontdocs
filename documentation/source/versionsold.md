# Detailed Version History

For a more concise log of versions see the [FONTLOG](FONTLOG.txt).

## Charis SIL v5.950 (beta)

_This is an early beta version of the next major release. Please use it only for testing, not production, and give us your feedback._

This is the first (beta) release that uses a UFO-based design and production workflow, with all sources in open formats and a completely open-source build toolkit. For more details see [SIL Font Development Notes](https://silnrsi.github.io/silfontdev/en-US/Introduction.html).

_This major release includes spacing changes to some glyphs, so text in existing documents may reflow. However, the spacing changes are mostly for rare glyphs that most users are not likely to use. If you see significant differences in layout between version 5.000 and this version of the fonts please let us know._
