<h3>Font Subsets</h3>
SIL's Non-Roman Script Initiative has created very comprehensive fonts for Latin and Cyrillic character sets. Charis SIL is a very large font that covers just about every need we know about in the Latin and Cyrillic world. Now, in the age of mobile devices and web usage, there is a need for fonts that are small and compact.

We have provided subsets for Africa, Americas, Asia/Pacific, Europe/Eurasia, Vietnam, Phonetic, Cyrillic (Basic) and Cyrillic Extended. With the exception of the Phonetic font, the font subsets are intended for orthographic use only. We have not put anything in the other subsets for phonetic, transliteration, or transcription use. For those purposes, use the Phonetic subset.

For more information and downloads see: [SIL Font Subsets](http://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/font-subsets/).

<h3>Modified Fonts for Special Uses</h3>
In addition to the font subsets described above, some [modified Charis SIL fonts](http://software.sil.org/lcgfonts/download/) are available  for a specific region or purpose:

* Africa (Mali) 
* Americas
* Eurasia 
* Literacy and Literacy Compact
